			<h2>Background</h2>
			<p>
			Will Wood is very reclusive and is "violently allergic to social media". He rarely shares any personal info
			and more often than not gives false information about himself. It is not entirely known whether his real name is
			Willian Joseph Colligan or something else. He often plays a "character" during performances and interviews, further 
			keeping his identity anonymous. He may or may not have an adopted daughter, may or may not live in a large exotic
			mansion in the forest, and may or may not have psychic powers. However, some facts about him are that he was born in New 
			Jersey, played in many bands, hasn't learned music theory, and is self-taught.
			</p>

		<!--Addiction and mental illness secion-->
		<section>
			<p>
			One thing that Will Wood does share is his past struggles involving addiction and mental illness. He had many issues regarding
			substance abuse in his past, which is reflected in his music. He was also diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder. Because of this,
			he donates portions of his earnings to charities that help with mental health stating "I’ve gotten a lot better. I want to try 
			and do something to help others get there."

		<!--Music career secion-->
		<section>
			<h2>Music Career</h2>
			<p>
			Through his music, Will Wood fearlessly explores themes of mental health, personal demons, and societal issues.
			An example would be the song "Jimmy Mushrooms’ Last Drink: Bedtime in Wayne, NJ". In this song, Will Wood
			explores the depressing life that comes from substance abuse. It is clear that he is expressing himself
			through the lyrics in this song. In addition, many of his earlier works show his wild personality, which
			may be from his Bipolar Disorder. He turns what many may consider his weakness into something that he can utilize.
			Will Wood's background serves as a testament to the power of self-expression and the cathartic nature of 
			art. Through his music, he invites listeners to embrace their own complexities and navigate the complexities
			of the world around them.

		<!--Influences section-->
		<section>
			<h2>Influences</h2>
			<p>
			In addition to being influenced by his own experiences, he also draws influence from outside sources. For one, he consumed
			a lot of psychedelic and classical music when he was young, but had a gravitation towards the avant-garde content. He also draws
			inspiration from Green Day, Billie Joe Armstrong, Tom Waits, Mr. Bungle, Father John Misty, Radiohead, Man Man, and Andrew Bird. <br>
			And something interesting: He might listen to Taylor Swift.
