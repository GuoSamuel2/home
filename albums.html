			<h2>"In case I make it,"</h2>
			<p>
			<span class="italicized">"In case I make it,"</span> was released on July 29, 2022, and is Will Wood's most recent album, not counting his live albums. This album is very unique compared to the others
			as it contains songs that are slower and calmer, in contrast to his other albums. From the hauntingly beautiful ballads to the chaotic yet calm anthems, the album 
			leaves a lasting impression with its thought-provoking lyrics and captivating musical arrangements. It is heavily inspired from Will Wood's post addiction and recovery
			phase. In addition, one of the songs, "Euthanasia", is made in honour of his pet rat that died, in addition to other songs on this album.<br>

			<h2>The Normal Album</h2>
			<p>
			<span class="italicized">The Normal Album</span> was released on July 10, 2020, and is significantly more calm than the previous albums. It explores themes of 
			normality and identity, in addition to psychology and personality. It mixes many genres such as jazz, disco, and new wave. It is arguably the most successful album 
			of Will Wood. This album invites listeners into a world of introspection, challenging societal norms and encouraging self-reflection. This album is likely inspired
			by Will Wood's own experiences with psychology and perspective as well as his experiences with identity. <br>

		<section id = "selfish">
			<h2>SELF-iSH</h2>
			<p>
			<span class="italicized">SELF-iSH</span> was released on August 23, 2016, and is one of the most chaotic albums there are. It is an experimental album that digs into
			"the self" and the concepts that come with it: such as personality, ego, memory, perspective, and identity. Furthermore, it explores concepts such as addiction and mental 
			illness. This album also represents Will Wood's new phase, abandoning is original stage name: "Dr. Sunshine". Each song in this album is its own narrative and tells their own
			story. This album attracted many loyal Will Wood fans due to how unique it was and how it appealed to many people that found meaning in the songs.<br>

			<h2>Everything is a Lot</h2>
			<p>
			<span class="italicized">Everything is a Lot</span> was released on May 20, 2015, marking the first studio album that Will Wood released. Its quality is extremely 
			high for a first album, though Will Wood did participate in many bands before this. It is mostly jazz, though like all his other albums, merges many genres. It dives
			deeply into substance abuse in addition existential crises, societal pressures, and relationships. In the 2020 Remastered Version, an additional song was added called 
			"Destroy to Enjoy". This album was the beginning of Will Wood's musical career, and is a very impressive starting point. <br>
