			<h2>The Real Will Wood</h2>
			<p>
			<span class="italicized">The Real Will Wood</span> was released on Feburary 8, 2020. It is a "part mockumentary, part ducumentary" that is meant to discover more about the enigmatic
			Will Wood. It is highly comedic that almost feels like a Will Wood album on its own. It has the chaos and variety, and also merges many genres -
			genres of film. And just like "the real Will Wood", much of the movie itself remains a mystery, such as whether or not Will gave his consent to 
			the film (though he likely did), how closely related the creators were with Will, and how much of the quirky interactions the "characters" in this
			film go through is actually real. It has an 8.6/10 stars rating on IMDb and is very unique for those who want a breath of fresh air in documentary genre.

			<h2>The Live Album</h2>
			<p>
			<span class="italicized">The Real Will Wood</span> came with a live album by the same name. It contained live editions of some songs that Will previously made,
			albeit under different names. They feel as if they were performed with more raw passion and is a good album to listen to as well.<br>
